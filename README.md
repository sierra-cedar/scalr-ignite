## [Sierra-Cedar DevOps Services](https://www.sierra-cedar.com/devops) help you effectively operate at scale in your Cloud Service Provider(s).  Sierra-Cedar is a [Scalr](https://scalr.com) partner.  Check out our [FlexOps](https://www.sierra-cedar.com/devops-services/) framework for getting your [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) code, version control, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure under control!

## The Ignite project by [Sierra-Cedar](http://www.sierra-cedar.com/flexops/) is designed to get you started quickly by deploying a sample business structure, including Environments, Workspaces, IAM Roles, IAM Access Policies, and IAM Teams to kickstart your [Scalr](https://scalr.com) experience, and to demonstrate the [Scalr provider](https://docs.scalr.com/en/latest/scalr-terraform-provider/) capabilities, further extending your ability to manage infrastructure as code at-scale.  The Terraform code is designed to be used in a Free-Tier Scalr account.

### Setup Instructions

1. Go to https://scalr.com and sign up for a Free Tier account, if you haven't already.

2. Collect Scalr information:
   1. ACCOUNT_ID     -> Found on the Scalr Account Dashboard (Green Menu Context)
   2. URL            -> Your personalized URL to access Scalr (your-account.scalr.io), including the .scalr.io

2. Install Terraform v1.1.4 or later (earlier releases may work, but are not tested or supported)

3. Clone/Fork this repository (https://github.com/sierra-cedar/scalr-ignite)

4. Edit the files labeled _UPDATE_ME_ in each sub-folder with the Scalr Information from Step 2 (above)

5. Setup your Scalr API credentials:
   1. Change to the **1 - OrgSDLC** sub-folder
   2. Using the URL from step 2.ii, run **terraform login _\<URL>_** and answer **yes** to storing your credentials.  
   3. A new browser window will open to create an API key in Scalr.  Give it a description (e.g., Scalr-Ignite) and click _Create_.  
   4. Copy the generated Token, and return to the command line where you ran **terraform login** and paste the Token.  

6. Navigate to the **1 - OrgSDLC** subfolder.
7. Run a **terraform init** to pull down the Scalr Provider and initialize the backend in Scalr. 

8. Run a **terraform plan**. 
   1. The terraform plan will provide a link to access the "dry run" in Scalr.  
   2. Output from the run will also be shown locally.  
   3. If successful, continue to step 7.  If there is a failure, double check that you edited the **_UPDATE_ME_** files appropriately.  

9. Run a **terraform apply**.  

Congratulations - you have deployed the Ignite template in Scalr!
