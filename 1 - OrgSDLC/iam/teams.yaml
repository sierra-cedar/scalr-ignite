# Teams are logical groups of people in Scalr.  People may belong to more than one team.                        #
#                                                                                                               #
# Teams are the "who is allowed to do this" in security, whereas Roles (iam/roles.yaml) are the "what are they  #
# allowed to do". Access policies (defined in environments/*.yaml as part of the environment definition) tie    #
# the Team and Role to a context, such as one or more environments or workspaces.                               #
